# AHT20 / BMP280 sensor library for Arduino
This is an AHT20 / BMP280 temperature/pressure/humidity sensor script for Arduino.
AHT20 + BMP280 chips are sold for less than a dollar on Ali.
 This script only uses the Wire.h library, nothing else.

## Arduino script features

-   Read temperature / humidity from AHT20
-    Read temperature / pressure from BMP280
- No long loop times when reading the AHT20
- Simple and clearly written
- So that even beginners (like me) can understand how it works
